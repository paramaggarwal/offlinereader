<p>“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”</p>

<p>“Breckinridge is his name.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!”</p>

<p>We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.</p>

<p>“Good-evening. It's a cold night,” said Holmes.</p>

<p>The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.</p>

<p>“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.</p>

<p>“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“That's no good.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”</p>

<p>“Who by?”</p>

<p>“The landlord of the Alpha.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”</p>

<p>“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”</p>

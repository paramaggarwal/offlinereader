<p>“‘Gone to the dealer's, Jem.’</p>

<p>“‘Which dealer's?’</p>

<p>“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’</p>

<p>“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’</p>

<p>“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.</p>

<p>“Get out!” said he.</p>

<p>“What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!”</p>

<p>“No more words. Get out!”</p>

<p>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.</p>

<p>“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.”</p>

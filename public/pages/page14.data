<p>“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink 'un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”</p>

<p>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.</p>

<p>“I've had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”</p>

<p>“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.</p>

<p>“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”</p>

<p>“She told me to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</p>

<p>“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.</p>

<p>“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.”</p>

<p>“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”</p>

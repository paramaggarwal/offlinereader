<p>To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.</p>

<p>“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now.”</p>

<p>“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”</p>

<p>“Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.”</p>

<p>“Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred,” snapped the salesman.</p>

<p>“It's nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“I say it is.”</p>

<p>“I don't believe it.”</p>

<p>“D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”</p>

<p>“You'll never persuade me to believe that.”</p>

<p>“Will you bet, then?”</p>

<p>“It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”</p>

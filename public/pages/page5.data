<p>“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection.”</p>

<p>“But he might be a bachelor.”</p>

<p>“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg.”</p>

<p>“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”</p>

<p>“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.</p>

<p>“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.</p>

<p>“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”</p>

<p>“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.”</p>

<p>“It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.”</p>

<p>“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.</p>

<p>“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we've set yours aside for you—Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’</p>

<p>“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.’</p>

<p>“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’</p>

<p>“‘Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you want, then?’</p>

<p>“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’</p>

<p>“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.</p>

<p>“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.</p>

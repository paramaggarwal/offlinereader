<p>“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.</p>

<p>“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly.”</p>

<p>“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.”</p>

<p>“By all means.”</p>

<p>It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</p>

<p>“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.</p>

<p>“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Whose, then?”</p>

<p>“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”</p>
